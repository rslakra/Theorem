      How to calculate the address of an element in 1-Dimensional array?

        ```
        A[i] = L0 + (i - LB) * W
        ```
      Here, ```i``` is an index of an element.
        - ```L0``` represents the base address of an array.
        - ```LB``` represents the lower bound of an array.
        - ```W``` represents the word size (the size of datatype).

    - Multi-Dimensional

      The memory is linear, so even in case of 2-dimensional array, the values are stored in 1-dimensional array.

      How to calculate the address of an element in 2-Dimensional array?

      ####Row-Major Mapping (If address starts with 0 onward)

        ```
        A[i, j] = L0 + (i * N + j) * W
        ```

      ####Row-Major Mapping (If address starts with 1 onward)

        ```
        A[i, j] = L0 + ((i - 1) * N + (j - 1)) * W
        ```

      Here, ```i``` and ```j``` are indices of row and column elements.
        - ```L0``` represents the base address of an array.
        - ```N``` represents the no. of columns in the array.
        - ```W``` represents the word size (the size of datatype).

      ####Column-Major Mapping (If address starts with 0 onward)

        ```
        A[i, j] = L0 + (j * M + i) * W
      
        ```
      ####Column-Major Mapping (If address starts with 1 onward)

        ```
        A[i, j] = L0 + ((j - 1) * M + (i - 1)) * W
        ```

      Here, ```i``` and ```j``` are indices of row and column elements.
        - ```L0``` represents the base address of an array.
        - ```M``` represents the no. of rows in the array.
        - ```W``` represents the word size (the size of datatype).
