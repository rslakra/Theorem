/**
 * In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci
 * sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding
 * ones:[1][2]
 * <p>
 * {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 89, 144, ...}, or
 * <p>
 * Often, especially in modern usage, the sequence is extended by one more initial term:
 * <p>
 * {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 89, 144, ...}
 * <p>
 * The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite
 * corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling;[4] this one uses squares of sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21. By
 * definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen
 * starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
 * <p>
 * The sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation: { fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) with seed
 * values (1) (2)} fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 1 or fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1
